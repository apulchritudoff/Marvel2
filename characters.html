          massive body due to being born with the Deviant Syndrome, Thanos was a morose child who became obsessed with
          the concept of death. Through bionic implementation and long hours of meditation, Thanos augmented his Eternal
          strengths and powers so that his abilities surpassed those of all other Titanian Eternals.</h4>
